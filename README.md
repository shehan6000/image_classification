# Image Classification using PyTorch in Codespaces

This repository contains a simple image classification application using PyTorch and a pre-trained ResNet50 model. The application loads an image, preprocesses it, and classifies it using the model. It then displays the top 5 predicted labels with their probabilities and visualizes the image.

## Setup
